# Circuit Puzzles
Circuit [puzzles](https://docs.chia.net/guides/crash-course/smart-coins) are what make the Circuit protocol tick. They are the building blocks of the protocol and used to create the stablecoin, Bytecash (BYC).

This is a Python package that includes all puzzles used by Circuit protocol.

## Status
The puzzles have undergone security audits by Zellic and competitions on Immunefi and Cantina:

* [Immunefi audit competition](./audits/Immunefi-invite-only-audit.pdf)
* [Cantina audit competition](./audits/Cantina-public-competition-audit.pdf)
