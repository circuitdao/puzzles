# Circuit Puzzles
Circuit puzzles are what make the Circuit protocol tick. They are the building blocks of the protocol and are used to create the stablecoin, Bytecash (BYC).

This is a python package that includes all puzzles used by Circuit protocol. 

## Project Status
The puzzles are in a _feature complete_ stage. They are functional, have undergone an initial internal code review, and been partly optimized.

An earlier version of these puzzles are currently in operation on [circuitdao.com](https://circuitdao.com) and undergoing testing on testnet 11.
